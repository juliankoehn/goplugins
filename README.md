# Luminate

Luminate is a learning Project.

Luminate is build to learn the [Go plugin Package](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/). The goal is to have a basic Framework Application that can be dynamically extended using auto-discovered plugins within the "plugins" folder.

Feel free to participate or come up with new ideas. Use it as a Boilerplate or whatever.

To keep things simple: the Routing Package is a Fork/Copy of the Echo router from LabStack. The Database is using Gorm.
